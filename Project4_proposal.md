**Introduction**

​	A job search is a time consuming process. Automating any part of the search would give a job seeker more time for networking and following up with potential employers.

**Goals**

​	Develop an app that takes in a resume and recommends recently posted  jobs that are a good match for the resume.

**MVP**

​	Minimum Viable Product is a comparative analysis of a resume and a list of scraped job descriptions. 

**Data**

*Job descriptions* scraped from *Indeed*.

*Resumes* found published on *LinkedIn* or other websites used by job seekers.

**Conclusions**

​	A job recommender app could perform a job search with fewer clicks and prioritize job postings based on the resume matching score.
